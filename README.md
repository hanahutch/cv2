## Hello.

My name is Hana and I'm currently studying to become a Web Developer. I graduated in 2020 from UC Riverside with a Bachelor's in Art. I have always been interested in digital design and tech in general so I'm purusing HTML, CSS
        and
        Javascript at the moment and plan to learn other coding languages like Python and Java. In my free time I enjoy reading, art, and music.
